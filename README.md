<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   The project employs the Python Turtle graphics library to create an interactive and visually appealing game window. The Turtle module makes it simple to draw the game elements and animations on the screen.
*   The project keeps track of the player's score which increases with each successful consumption of food by the snake. The longer the snake becomes the higher the score.
*   When the snake collides with the boundaries or itself the game enters a "Game Over" state. The player is presented with their final score and the option to restart the game.
